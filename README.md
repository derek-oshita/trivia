## Trivia Trainer!

Link to application: https://tandem-trivia-trainer.herokuapp.com/

Trivia Trainer is my first attempt at a trivia game. It started off as a take-home project for the Tandem SE Apprenticeship and quickly became one of my favorite projects to work on. The application is designed to help users practice their trivia by answering multiple-choice questions (provided by Tandem) and tracking their score. 

I decided to model the game after Jeopardy! as it is my favorite game show and obviously, the best game show ever. 

## Technologies Used

Dependencies: 
- React
- react-router-dom
- Enzyme Testing 

Styling: 
- Animate.style CDN 
- Google Fonts CDN 

When reviewing the Tandem project prompt, I immediately thought of a one-page application and decided to go with React. I have grown to love React due to it's component-based encapsulation and performance, but because I'm still new to it, React continues to yield challenges that I wanted to face!

## How to run

Be sure to clone this repo down $cd into the directory. 

### `npm i`

Run 'npm i' from the command line to install all the dependencies. 

### `npm start`

Run 'npm start' in order to run the application. 
The application will load a window to 'localhost:3000

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
